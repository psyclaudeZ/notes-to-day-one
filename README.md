# notes-to-day-one
A simple script that converts notes from Notes.app on macOS to Day One entries. Built solely for my own
setup but should be a good starting point to customize for yours.

A couple of notes on this script:
1. Built and tested on Big Sur (11.4).
2. Depends on [Day One CLI](https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/435871-command-line-interface-cli).
3. By default writes to default journal on Day One. 
4. Brutally loops thorugh all notes under Note folder of Notes.app (Yo Dawg). 
5. AppleScript is absurd.
